# Hi, I'm Ahmad Nayfeh 👋
**AI Engineer & Data Scientist**

I build end-to-end intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My work spans **Computer Vision**, **Signal Processing**, and **Data Engineering**—transforming complex data into production-ready applications.

### 💡 About Me
As an M.Sc. candidate at KFUPM, I specialize in applying deep learning to practical challenges. My focus is on delivering complete, data-driven solutions.

I see AI not as a magic box, but as a powerful engineering partner. With the right guidance and a deep understanding of its capabilities, AI becomes a force multiplier, enabling us to achieve extraordinary results with less effort. My goal is to build tools that teach, assist, and inspire.
