## 💡 About Me

As an M.Sc. candidate at KFUPM with a foundation in Electrical Engineering, I am passionate about the entire lifecycle of AI systems. My philosophy is to use AI not as a black box, but as a powerful engineering partner to create solutions that are robust, efficient, and impactful.

- 🔭 **I'm currently working on** enhancing my skills in MLOps and scalable model deployment
- 🌱 **My core focus is on** building reproducible data pipelines and developing solutions from ideation to production
- 📫 **I'm open to** collaborating on innovative projects and discussing challenging opportunities in AI and data science

## 🚀 My Projects

### 🏆 Cloud-Native Reading Analytics Platform
Architected a full-stack, multi-tenant data product to manage and gamify group reading challenges. Features a complete ETL pipeline using Google Cloud APIs and Firebase, a dynamic gamification engine, and automated PDF reporting.

### 🧠 AI-Powered MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation
Developed a ResNet-UNet model achieving a **96.34% Dice Score** on the BraTS dataset, outperforming typical human-expert consistency. The end-to-end system includes a robust 3D-to-2D preprocessing pipeline, a hybrid BCE+Dice loss function, and is deployed as an interactive Streamlit app.

### ⚙️ AI-Powered Bearing Fault Diagnosis
Built a predictive maintenance pipeline using a custom 1D CNN for time-series classification of industrial bearing faults. Addressed severe class imbalance with SMOTE and validated model robustness by adding AWGN, maintaining perfect accuracy at 25% noise and graceful degradation to 87% at 50% noise.

### Additional Projects
I also have experience developing reproducible research frameworks for **Self-Supervised Learning** ([Modular SimCLR](https://github.com/Ahmad-Nayfeh/SimCLR-Augmentation-Analysis-CIFAR-10)) and building systems for **real-time object detection**.
