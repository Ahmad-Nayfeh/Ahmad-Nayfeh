# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmad Nayfeh

I'm an Electrical Engineer and AI researcher passionate about building reproducible pipelines in **computer vision**, **signal processing**, and **self-supervised learning**. I create highly visual, educational tools that bridge theoretical depth with real-world applications.

## 💼 About Me

I’m an **Electrical Engineering graduate from KFUPM**, specialized in **signal processing** and **image processing**. Over time, I’ve become deeply invested in the world of **artificial intelligence** and **computer vision**, where I focus on building tools that combine rigorous engineering with human-centered design.

🔍 I don’t see AI as a magic box — but as a powerful extension of human thinking. With the right guidance, prompting, and understanding of its capabilities, AI becomes a force multiplier — enabling us to achieve **extraordinary results with less effort**.

🧠 My **[personal website](https://ahmadnayfeh.vercel.app)** was built entirely through AI — not with one prompt, but through a structured, multi-step process. From design to content, I guided AI to build each part using clear prompts and deep tool understanding. It’s proof that with the right mindset, **AI can become a powerful engineering partner — not just a shortcut**.

🚀 My mission is to **harness AI to simplify life, magnify impact, and build tools that teach, assist, and inspire**.
